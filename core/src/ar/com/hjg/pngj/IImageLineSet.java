 * <ul>
 * <li>Cursor-like: stores only one line, which is implicitly moved when
 * requested</li>
 * <li>All lines: all lines stored as an array of <tt>IImageLine</tt></li>
 * <li>Subset of lines: eg, only first 3 lines, or odd numbered lines. Or a band
 * of neighbours lines that is moved like a cursor.</li> The ImageLine that
 * PngReader returns is hosted by a IImageLineSet (this abstraction allows the
 * implementation to deal with interlaced images cleanly) but the library user
 * does not normally needs to know that (or rely on that), except for the
 * {@link PngReader#readRows()} method.
