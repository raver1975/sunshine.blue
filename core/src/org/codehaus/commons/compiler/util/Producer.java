/**
 * An object that produces some {@link Object} each time the {@link #produce()} method is invoked. This
 * behavior is similar to the {@link java.util.Iterator}, but is represented by one single {@link #produce()} method as
 * opposed to {@link java.util.Iterator}'s two methods {@link java.util.Iterator#hasNext()} and {@link
 * java.util.Iterator#next()}. This simplifies the implementation of certain complex iterations.
