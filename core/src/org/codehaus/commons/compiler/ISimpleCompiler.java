/**
 * A simplified Java compiler that can compile only a single compilation unit. (A "compilation unit" is the document
 * stored in a ".java" file.)
 * <p>
 *   Opposed to a normal ".java" file, you can declare multiple public classes here.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   To set up an {@link ISimpleCompiler} object, proceed as follows:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Create an {@link ISimpleCompiler}-implementing object</li>
 *   <li>Optionally set an alternate parent class loader through {@link #setParentClassLoader(ClassLoader)}.</li>
 *   <li>
 *     Call any of the {@link ICookable#cook(String, Reader)} methods to scan, parse, compile and load the compilation
 *     unit into the JVM.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Call {@link #getClassLoader()} to obtain a {@link ClassLoader} that you can use to access the compiled classes.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * <h3>Comptibility notice:</h3>
 * <p>
 *   The methods {@code setPermissions(Permissions permissions)} and {@code void setNoPermissions()} were removed in
 *   version 3.1.1 (2020-03-09) and replaced by the {@link Sandbox}.
 * </p>
